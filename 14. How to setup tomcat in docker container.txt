---------------------------- HOW TO SETUP TOMCAT IN DOCKER CONTAINER IN CENTOS -----------------------------

1. First you need to open putty and login.

2. Then to install docker if you try ($ sudo yum install -y docker) then it will say NO DOCKER PACKAGES. This means
   you didnt store any docker.repo in yum repos. To check repositories in yum ($ cd /etc/yum.repos.d). You dont
   find any Docker.repo in it.

3. So we can download directly by giving the following command ($ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh)
   With this docker will be installed.

4. We need to give the docker privileges to the ec2-user as follows ($ sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user)
   By creating this privilege, from next time if you run docker command you wont need to give sudo. 

5. Now ($ sudo service docker start) will start the docker. After this you can pull the docker image from dockerhub.
   For this ($ docker pull tomcat:8.0). If you want any specific version, you can give your version as before.

6. To check the docker images ($ docker images)
   To check the docker processes ($ docker ps )

7. Docker will pull tomcat image and to run that image ($ docker run -d -p 9999:8080 tomcat:8.0)
   Here 9999 is the port which i allocated for docker image
        8080 is the prefixed port for that tomcat image
        tomcat:8.0 is the image name you want to run

8. Now you can check the running processes using ($ docker ps). 

9. Now you can browse tomcat with the port you allocated. But, for tomcat there will be a problem logging in to 
   manager app. So you need to mount volume  because vi editor wont work in docker to edit tomcat-users.xml file.

10. So you need to create a dummy folder in root and mount the volume of that dummy folder with any folder inside 
    docker container. 

11. To mount volume you need to kill the running process. To do so ($ docker kill container id). Mounting volume 
    in the sense running the process. So you need to kill the present running processes.

12. To mount volume ($ docker run -d -p 9999:8080 -v /home/ec2-user/dummy:/usr/local/tomcat/temp tomcat:8.0)
    Here -v is nothing but mounting volume
         dummy is folder you created in root
         /usr/local/tomcat/temp is the path of temp folder in docker container.

13. Now you need to copy tomcat-user.xml(which will be in the tomcat installed in your ec2-user) to the dummy file
    you created in the root. Now tomcat-users.xml will be in the temp folder inside the docker. To check that you 
    need to go into docker ($ sudo exec -it containerid bash).

14. You can get container id by ($ docker ps). After going in to container, move tomcat-user.xml from temp to conf.
    You need to move it but not copy it. Because, if you move it , it will be replaced with the file in conf.

15. After this you need to exit from the docker by simply typing ($ exit). Now you need to restart the container 
    ($ docker restart containerid)

16. After restarting, you can access manager app with the credentials in your tomcat-user.xml

17. Done!

------------------------------ SOME MORE COMMANDS USED IN DOCKER-------------------------------------

$ (docker ps -a) To see the exited or dangled processes

$ (docker rm $(docker ps -aq)  To kill the exited or dangled processes

$ (docker rmi $(docker images -aq) To kill the dangled images

$ (docker rmi imageid) To remove the selected image

$ (docker rmi -f imageid) To force remove the selected image.
